# Pneumonia-Detection
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture, the model classifies images into two categories: "Normal" and "Pneumonia".

## Key Features

- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained VGG16 model weights to enhance model performance and reduce training time.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applies various transformations to the training data, improving model robustness.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations of training and validation loss and accuracy metrics to monitor model performance.
- **Single Image Prediction**: Implements functionality to predict the class of a single chest X-ray image.
